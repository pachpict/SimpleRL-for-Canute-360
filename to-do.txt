# To-do

## Mostly map rendering:

 - Also present overview first, really panned out, which shows general locations around town.
 - Add buildings as another letter on the map, maybe with hyphens.

## Mostly interface:


 - Allow user to write their own story on the fly:
 - Add instructions.
 - Stop user falling off edge of the world and crashing the program.
 - Add levels.
	 - Add practice levels and tutorials.
	 - Add The Mall, Cribbs Causeway, for Paul.
	 - Add the hotel for major conferences, for Braille conferences.
 - Let location events turn on/of other location events.
 	- Turn off by story file not by line number, as need to be able to define multiple points for story to occur, mostly just points next to each other.
 - Allow true one-move diagnonal movement (https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52910090/how-to-check-for-multiple-key-presses-in-python-keyboard-module, https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api).
 - Fill in ways for buildings? Currently they are outlines. Requires new line drawing function. They ought to be filled in if you are showing top down view of how one moves around a city, but then again getting the shape is quite nice and maybe better for appreciating form.
 - Add fuzzy logic "Go to way" search, which wangs the player to the closest match for the string they enter. (https://typesense.org/learn/fuzzy-string-matching-python/)
 - Is discombobulating to move around the map, made worse by horizontal centring but vertical not. Change and make less discombolulating. This is hiding a much bigger question of how one moves around maps like this...
 	- Centre in both dimensions when redrawing map, as a starter. Warning: Will make much slower to move around on a Canute, but has to be tried.
 	- Or revert back to appearing at the other side of the map.
 		- Both require testing before adoption.

# Done:

 x Scrap momentum (doing so creates difficulties with diagonal movement).
 x Cut out pedestrian ways.
 x Create inverted map version for alternative game modes (clear roads because when you are on them they are labelled).
 x Make the roads wider horizontally on inverted generation.
 x Label roads clearly (first letter is unclear according to Paul and others), possibly by:
 	x Turning the map into a kind of word-search where the symbol painted cycles through the alphanumberic letters of the road name.
 x Needs to blank out the letters on roads (with intersect character like "-") when they are near alternative roads, possibly with a left-right check, blanking out any letters on cells to the left and right that belong to other highways, or something like it.
 x Decided in favour of inverted mode, have archived the word-search mode.
 x Make the map centre when travelling left or right off edge (am not doing same for up/down as its my assumption that would be too arduous for travel as can only then travel four lines without map refresh).
 x Remove the reference to 'driving' as the interaction is no longer like driving, and are proposing going into buildings.
 x Now are travelling by foot add pedestrian ways back in.
 x Display co-ordinates so user can alt tab to the story csv and dir to add new story point.
 x Add extra instruction line with next destination, including the co-ordinates.

# Cancelled:

 - Make momentum optional and default to no momentum (presents difficulties with diagonal movement).
 - Paint trunk/main roads *after* normal roads so they get priority
 - Render maps at smaller scale, i.e. panned out. First try fitting about 150% on screen (tried it and it made it worse).
 - As suggested by Paul, actually label the roads in the traditional fashion, somehow.
 - Paint underscore or similar non-alphanumberic symbol where roads intersect. Started...
 	- Current issues are that it doesn't work very reliably (why?), and...
 	- ... Even if it did it would leave too many letter jumbles, so...
 	- Duel carriage ways are a problem; OSM doesn't seem to distinguish between the nodes for each lane, but having both lanes creates a total mess of letters.
