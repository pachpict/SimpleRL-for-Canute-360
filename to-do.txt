 - Add multi-page instructions.
 - Add levels.
 - Add practice levels.
 - Label roads clearly (first letter is unclear according to Paul and others), possibly by:
 	- Turning the map into a kind of word-search where the symbol painted cycles through the alphanumberic letters of the road name.
 	- Or, as suggested by Paul, actually label the roads in the traditional fashion, somehow.
 - Make momentum optional and default to no momentum (presents difficulties with diagonal movement).
 - Allow true one-move diagnonal movement.
 - Render maps at smaller scale, i.e. panned out. First try fitting about 150% on screen.
 - Also present overview first, really panned out, which shows general locations around town.
 - Cut out pedestrian ways.
 - *Either*:
 	- Paint trunk/main roads *after* normal roads so they get priority, *or*
 	- Paint underscore or similar non-alphanumberic symbol where roads intersect, *or*
 	- Some combination of the above that in some other way halps distinguish between roads.
 - Let location events turn on/of other location events.
